 * Outcome contains a single outcome on which a bet can be placed.
 * In Roulette, each spin of the wheel has a number of Outcomes with bets that will be paid off.
 * For example, the “1” bin has the following winning Outcomes: “1”, “Red”, “Odd”, “Low”, “Column 1”,
 * “Dozen 1-12”, “Split 1-2”, “Split 1-4”, “Street 1-2-3”, “Corner 1-2-4-5”, “Five Bet”, “Line 1-2-3-4-5-6”,
 * “00-0-1-2-3”, “Dozen 1”, “Low” and “Column 1”. All of these bets will payoff if the wheel spins a “1”.
